There are 4 files in the folder:

pj2.l:
	The lex file of project2
pj2.y:
	The yacc file of project2
makefile:
	To compile the project
Readme:
	The file that you are reading now

The executable program is called scc after you make the project. So the command to execute the program is:
	./scc data.in data.out

This program generate the llvm intermediate code for source programs.For more details you can check codes and notes of pj2.l, pj2.y and project report. 
I do two extra parts: Error detection and some code optimazation. For more details you can check codes and notes of pj2.y and project report.
