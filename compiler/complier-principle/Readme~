There are 4 files in the folder:

pj1.l:
	The lex file of project1
pj1.y:
	The yacc file of project1
makefile:
	To compile the project
Readme:
	The file that you are reading now

The executable program is called pj1 after you make the project. So the command to execute the program is:
	./pj1 data.in data.out

This program creates the parsing tree and store all the terminal information. For more details you can check codes and notes of pj1.y.
I also implemented several error detection methods and return line number and type imformation(such as syntax err; unexpected charactor;expected ";";expected")" etc)
